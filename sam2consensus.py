'''
The program takes as input a SAM file (.sam or .sam.gz) resulting from mapping short reads to a reference (the reference
sequences can correspond to separate genes for example), then it calculates the consensus sequence from the aligned
reads alone. A single or multiple consensus thresholds can be specified, the program also adds insertions, if many long
long insertions are expected, we recommend to perform indel ralignment before for optimal results. The consensus method
is the one used by Geneious and described in detail in http://assets.geneious.com/manual/8.1/GeneiousManualse41.html

Regions with no coverage are filled with -s (or a different character if specified). Input SAM files don't need to be
sorted. Original reference FASTAs are not necessary since the consensus is reference-free.

It will produce a FASTA file per reference containing as many sequences as thresholds were specified.
